This project was an excersise to help students learn the basis of creating a world and objects in the 3D space of the Godot Engine. What I have created here is a simple 3D terrain where you can control a sphere by inputing the WASD keys. Throughout the process of creating this assignment, I have learned how to manipulate 3D objects, write code that allows movement, and create static terrain.
